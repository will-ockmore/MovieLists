### MovieLists

Material design / mobile first web app for finding a movie to watch.

Built using the great API provided by [TheMovieDb](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).

[See it in action!](http://movielist.willockmore.com/)

Uses React with redux and redux-saga - tests with the new jest, including snapshots.

To setup, clone the repo and run `yarn install` (or `npm i`). Then start the server with `yarn start` (`npm run start`).
